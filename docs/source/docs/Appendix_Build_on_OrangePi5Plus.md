- **Download Link**: [Orange Pi 5 Plus Ubuntu 22.04 Image](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l72cF6dsTzwU5NloY3FEKTuKA9KbhX80/view?usp=drive_link)  
- **Image Version**: Ubuntu 22.04 Jammy Desktop XFCE with Linux kernel 6.1.43  
- **File Size**: Approximately 4GB (compressed)  


Extract the downloaded 7z archive:
```bash
7z x Orangepi5plus_1.2.0_ubuntu_jammy_desktop_xfce_linux6.1.43.7z
```

!!! note "NOTE" 

    If 7-Zip is not installed, install it using:
    ```bash
    # Ubuntu/Debian
    sudo apt install p7zip-full

    # CentOS/RHEL
    sudo yum install p7zip
    ```

### [Step 1.2] Flashing the SD Card

!!! warning "WARNING" 

    Replace `/dev/sda` with your actual SD card device. Use `lsblk` or `fdisk -l` to identify the correct device.

```bash
sudo umount /dev/sda

sudo dd if=./Orangepi5plus_1.2.0_ubuntu_jammy_desktop_xfce_linux6.1.43.img of=/dev/sda bs=4M status=progress

sync
```

**Alternative Methods**  

- **Raspberry Pi Imager**: Cross-platform GUI tool  
- **Balena Etcher**: User-friendly flashing utility  
- **Win32DiskImager**: Windows-specific tool  

### [Step 1.3] Initial Boot & Credentials

  - (1) Insert the SD card into the Orange Pi 5 Plus  
  - (2) Connect power supply and peripherals  
  - (3) Power on the device  

**Default Credentials** (if applicable)  

- Username: `orangepi`  
- Password: `orangepi`  

## [Step 2] DX-RT NPU Driver & Runtime Installation 

Install the necessary drivers and runtime for the DEEPX NPU accelerator.

All following steps should be performed on the Orange Pi 5 Plus itself after successful boot.

### [Step 2.1] Updating Linux Kernel Headers

Install the required kernel headers for driver compilation:

```bash
cd /opt
sudo apt install ./linux-headers-current-rockchip-rk3588_1.2.0_arm64.deb
```

!!! note "NOTE" 

    The kernel headers package should be pre-installed in the Orange Pi image. If missing, contact DEEPX support.

**(Optional) Configure Git**

If you encounter SSL certificate issues with GitHub:

```bash
git config --global http.sslVerify false
```

!!! note "NOTE" 

    This disables SSL verification globally. For production use, consider configuring proper certificates instead.

### [Step 2.2] Compiling NPU Linux Driver

```bash
cd ~
mkdir -p dxnn && cd dxnn
git clone https://github.com/DEEPX-AI/dx_rt_npu_linux_driver.git
cd dx_rt_npu_linux_driver/modules
./build.sh
sudo ./build.sh -c install
```

**What this does**:  

- Downloads the NPU kernel driver source code

- Compiles the driver for the current kernel

- Installs the driver modules and creates device nodes

### [Step 2.3] Installing DX-RT Runtime

```bash
cd ~/dxnn
git clone https://github.com/DEEPX-AI/dx_rt.git
cd dx_rt
./install.sh --all
./build.sh
```

**Build Options**:

- `--all`: Installs all dependencies and development tools

- Alternative: `./install.sh --minimal` for runtime-only installation

### [Step 2.4] Verifying Installation (dxcli)

Test the NPU driver and runtime installation:

```bash
dxcli -s
```

!!! note "NOTE"
    `dxcli` is the standard CLI tool. Legacy name `dxrt-cli` remains available as a backward-compatible alias.

**Expected Output**:
```
DXRT v3.0.0
=======================================================
 * Device 0: M1, Accelerator type
---------------------   Version   ---------------------
 * RT Driver version   : v1.7.1
 * PCIe Driver version : v1.4.1

dvfs Disabled
=======================================================
```

**Quick Diagnostics** (If Device is Not Detected)  

If the `dxcli -s` command fails to detect the hardware, execute the following diagnostic checks sequentially.  

```bash
# 1. Verify if the DEEPX NPU kernel driver module is loaded into the system
lsmod | grep dx

# 2. Inspect kernel system logs for any DEEPX driver initialization or PCIe handshake errors
dmesg | grep -i deepx
```
